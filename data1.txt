When a user views the affected page, the malicious code executes in their web browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.There are several types of XSS attacks, including : 1) Stored XSS: In a stored XSS attack, the malicious code is stored in a database or on a server and is displayed to all users who view the affected page. 2)Reflected XSS: In a reflected XSS attack, the malicious code is sent to the server through a web form or URL parameter, and is reflected back to the user in the response. 3) DOM-based XSS: In a DOM-based XSS attack, the malicious code is injected into the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, rather than into the server's response."],
